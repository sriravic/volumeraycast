Volumetric Ray Casting

This is a basic volumetric ray casting application that is used to visualize volumetric data. As of now only RAW data format is to be supported. 

GPU rendering is intended functionality. Multithreaded rendering might be very basic limited to openmp pragmas but I am not sure of how this will turn up.

Its intended to serve as basic starter code for people who wish to set up a quick and dirty version for their visualization purposes.
